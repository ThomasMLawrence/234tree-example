This program simulates a menu of food items split
into three items. A main dish, drink, and dessert.
The menu keeps track of potential allergic properties
of the food as well as calories. New food items can 
be added and viewed.

To run the program simply type make and run ./menu.

clean removes the executable and clear removes the executable
and object files as well.
